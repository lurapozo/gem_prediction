# Gem Prediction

Learning how to use FastApi with Jira2 templates and poetry. 
In this project I'll be comparing multiple regression models to predict the prices of a Zirconia gem based on its attributes.

Data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colearninglounge/gemstone-price-prediction/data).
